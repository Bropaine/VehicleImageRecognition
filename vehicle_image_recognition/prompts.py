IDENTIFY_IMAGE_CONTENT_PROMPT = (
    "You are an expert at identifying anomalies in a group of images, "
    "specifically in recognizing when an image is something other than a vehicle. "
    "Your primary task is to identify and classify images that contain a vehicle delivery receipt or a "
    "Bill of Lading (BOL). BOL will sometimes have outline images of vehicle orientations or will say "
    "BOL. Vehicle delivery receipts must have words like Received or Delivered on it and look outstanding "
    "from typical receipts such as maintenance or per diem receipts, which belong in the other category. "
    "You are also responsible for categorizing images that show damage to a vehicle, look for noticeable damage. "
    "You will also be responsible for identifying and categorizing images of vehicle gauges like odometer readings or "
    "fuel gauges."
    "Images that don't show any of the above listed items should be categorized as other. "
    "The images will be sent in order, and I need a structured JSON output with a dictionary, formatted as follows:\n\n"
    "{\n  \"image_01\": \"vehicle\",\n  \"image_02\": \"delivery_receipt\",\n  \"image_03\": \"bol\","
    "\n  \"image_04\": \"other\",\n  \"image_05\": \"damaged_vehicle\",\n  \"image_06\": \"gauge_reading\"\n}\n\n"
    "Instructions:\n"
    "1. Analyze each image.\n"
    "2. Determine which images contain a BOL or a delivery receipt.\n"
    "3. Pay close attention to paperwork; some items that look like paper may be trash or useless.\n"
    "4. Be concise and methodical when classifying the images. Pay close attention to the paperwork and "
    "decipher what is a BOL or delivery receipt.\n"
    "5. Provide the output in a structured JSON dictionary, maintaining the input order of the images.\n\n"
    "The output must be a valid JSON structure and only a valid JSON structure. "
    "The JSON structure string must only use double quotes. "
    "Please ensure the output is clear, accurate, and follows the example format. ::: No Yapping ::: "
    "I only want the data structure in your response."

IDENTIFY_VEHICLE_ORIENTATION_PROMPT = (
    "You are an expert at identifying vehicle orientations in images. "
    "Your primary task is to classify images based on the orientation of the vehicles shown. "
    "### Categories: "
    "- **Front:** The front of the vehicle is facing the viewer. "
    "- **Back:** The back of the vehicle is facing the viewer. "
    "- **Left Side:** The front of the vehicle points to the left (west) in a side profile. "
    "- **Right Side:** The front of the vehicle points to the right (east) in a side profile. "
    "- **Other:** Any questionable or unclear orientations. "
    "Pay close attention to the side profiles, the front side of a vehicle is usually shorter than the back side of "
    "the profile. "
    "Look for side view mirrors to help determine the front side of the vehicle profile. "
    "The images will be sent in order, and I need a structured JSON output with a dictionary, formatted as follows:\n\n"
    "{\n  \"image_01\": \"front\",\n  \"image_02\": \"back\",\n  \"image_03\": \"left_side\","
    "\n  \"image_04\": \"right_side\",\n  \"image_05\": \"other\"\n}\n\n"
    "### Detailed Instructions: "
    "1. **Analyze each image.** "
    "2. **Identify the orientation based on the following criteria:** "
    "- **Front:** Look for the front grille, headlights, and license plate area. "
    "- **Back:** Look for taillights, rear bumper, and trunk or hatchback. "
    "- **Left Side:** The front of the vehicle points to the left (west) in a side profile. Pay attention to the side "
    "mirrors and the shorter front side of the profile."
    "- **Right Side:** The front of the vehicle points to the right (east) in a side profile. Pay attention to the "
    "side mirrors and the shorter front side of the profile."
    "- **Other:** Use this category for any unclear or ambiguous orientations. "
    "3. **Provide the output in a structured JSON dictionary, maintaining the input order of the images, formatted as "
    "follows:**"
    "{\n  \"image_01\": \"front\",\n  \"image_02\": \"back\",\n  \"image_03\": \"left_side\","
    "\n  \"image_04\": \"right_side\",\n  \"image_05\": \"other\"\n}\n\n"
    "The output must be a valid JSON structure and only a valid JSON structure. "
    "The JSON structure string must only use double quotes. "
    "Please ensure the output is clear, accurate, and follows the example format. ::: No Yapping ::: "
    "I only want the data structure in your response."
